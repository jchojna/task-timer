# TaskTimer App
[master branch](https://github.com/jchojna/task-timer/tree/master)

## Project info
You could say this is just another Pomodoro Clock react app, but this one is a little bit more complex and playful. I tried to make it look more like a board game with cards, interactive and entertaining. The app can handle multiple tasks going on at the same time, even though it may not be too practical to work on many tasks simultaneously, but it’s nice to see so many countdowns in action anyway:)
